# Wild-Life
This is the source code for the Wild-Life Android application, soon to be up on Google Play for free.

## What is Wild-Life?
Wild-Life is an Android application for displaying your photography of animals of different species, alongside an informative encyclopedia.
The more pictures you take, the larger your database for that species grows. You can view your images in a gallery, and can save or
delete images at will. Expand your knowledge as you increase your photography skills, and learn more about the animals you observe.

## What's the plan?
More animals will be added as the project progresses, even after the initial release, as well as new features.

## Inspiration?
I always loved the aspect of observing Wild-Life, especially from my time reading numerous documentaries. Unfortunately, I'm no zoologist,
and I'm definitely no expert in the field. It would be neat being a citizen scientist, taking photographs of animals around my area,
and learning along the journey. Wild-Life allows us to do both.

## Contributions
I would love those who wish to contribute to the project. This application is also a learning experience for me, both in learning more
about animals, as well as coding and creating an Android application.
